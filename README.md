# Dungeon Squads

[View the deployed site here](https://pages.github.com)

Dungeon Squads is a website for an online "Dungeons and Dragons" gaming community. It will bring people together who are looking for a safe, social, gaming space.
The website was created for my first milestone project as part of the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The website is responsive on all device sizes.

## User Experience (UX)
 
With varying degrees of lockdowns due to the Coronavirus pandemic, it can be hard to make new friends, or keep in touch with existing friends. One could easily find themselves feeling isolated, 
even with the prevelance of social media.

This online community will advance the user's goals by providing them with an opportunity to connect with other gamers in a fun, safe environment, and by allowing them to easily learn the 
basics of the "Dungeons and Dragons" game. It will also advance the site owners goals of growing their community, and spreading knowledge of and enthusiasm for the "Dungeons and Dragons" game.
